# Homework 4 Javasqript Quiz

## This is my homework 4 which is named Javasqript quiz. Unfortunatly I have not finished it 100% but I think it does show my progression as a programmer. I am proud of the work even though it is not a finished product. 

# Opportunities 
## With everything that is a learned skill, there will be some opportunities along the way. Some things I need to work on are being more dynamic which my Javascript and being able to connect my HTML elements and have it make sense within the logic in my Javascript. 

## Another opportunity is I need to go over and try to understand how functions, methods and conditional statmements work.
